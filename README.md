# Superstore-Sales-Visual-Storytelling-Dashboard
This project analyzes sales data from the Superstore dataset to uncover key business insights. Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard featuring KPIs, sales trends, regional performance, product analysis, and discount impact. The goal is to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions by visualizing patterns in sales and profitability.
